The easiest reaction is Deuterium-Tritium, but only ~50% of the energy produced can be collected for human use. The next easiest reaction is Deuterium-Helium3, which has the advantage of nearly 100% energy recovery for human use. However, practical controlled thermonuclear fusion has not been achieved yet, but we are working on it. Check out the following link: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ITER\nHelium3 does not essentially exist on Earth, and our Earthly supply comes from decommissioned Hydrogen bombs\/nuclear weapons, which is an extremely meager and unreliable source. There is a mineral on the Moon called ilmenite which has a curiously receptive crystal structure that easily traps and holds Helium3 within. Thus, in the vacuum of space, the Moon gets continuously bombarded by the solar wind, (which contains small amounts of Helium3), and over millions of years, the ilmenite soaks up and stores the Helium3, waiting for us to come and harvest it for use in our fusion reactors."},{"text":"e. The sun is 370 times further from Earth than the moon. \nI think the way you do it is, you convert 8 min into seconds and that is 480 seconds, then do 480\/1.3 and you get something like 369.231. So, approximately, 370."},{"text":"Don't be silly. Are you very young? Or possibly a troll? No offense, but that's what you sound like.\n.\nIn the current configuration, there's no way this could happen. The Moon is on average 93,000,000 miles from the Sun, and never comes close enough to collide. If such an event such as a rouge planet entering our system and hurling the Earth and Moon out of our current course, we would have far greater problems than worrying about the Sun swallowing the Moon. And that's what would happen--the Moon is tiny compared to the Sun, so the Sun would just gobble up the Moon. Bye, bye, Moon.\n.\nAnd by the way, the Moon rises in the day also. Keep your eye on it for a month and see what happens.\n.\n\"The sky seems so small \" Really?

The moon is currently a waxing crescent, which means it is pretty closely following the Sun in its motion across the sky. In a few days it will be rising at around midday and setting around midnight, then a week later it will be full and rising around sunset, being in the sky all night and setting in the morning. After that it will rise later and later and be visible in the sky during the daylight morning hours.\n\nThis is the normal lunar cycle."},{"text":"I actually like being teased a bit, it's sexy, but I don't think if a guy kept doing that I'd like it because I'd feel led on and dumped (._.\"). \n\nLibra Sun, Aqua Moon, and Scorpio Mars :)"},{"text":"Measure in AU"}],"images":[{"url":"http:\/\/farm3.staticflickr.com\/2083\/1802221767_bdccbfe123.jpg"},{"url":"http:\/\/farm3.staticflickr.com\/2130\/2232956875_4bc0280e71.jpg"},{"url":"http:\/\/farm3.staticflickr.com\/2380\/1803058098_42a55ca9a9.jpg"},{"url":"http:\/\/farm3.staticflickr.com\/2354\/1803142160_4f5c2f1d79.jpg"},{"url":"http:\/\/farm3.staticflickr.com\/2208\/1802289445_31c56fcbf0.jpg"},{"url":"http:\/\/farm3.staticflickr.com\/2024\/1802209819_9348b517e5.jpg"},{"url":"http:\/\/farm3.staticflickr.com\/2296\/1802294819_381d20ad18.jpg"},{"url":"http:\/\/farm3.staticflickr.com\/2069\/1802179823_dd092ef016.jpg"},{"url":"http:\/\/farm3.staticflickr.com\/2076\/1803046038_db5683c6bb.jpg"},{"url":"http:\/\/farm3.staticflickr.com\/2175\/1802157969_30721db7a5.jpg"}]}
